In some ways it's like <a href=\"#!/guide/cirrus\">Cirrus</a> (the word cloud) but even more useful with the added collocates and corpus coverage information.</p>\n\n<p>The highest frequency terms (or most distinct terms if you change the options) appear in the middle and in larger bubbles, with terms spiralling outwards. The darkness of the terms represents the proportion of the documents where the term appears (darker means that it appears in more documents; there will be no differentiation if there's only one document in the corpus).</p>\n\n<p>When you hover over a term it becomes the keyword and then each of the other bubbles will indicate the collocate frequency for that term (within the specified context, by default two words the left and two words to the right). The darker the colour, the higher the collocate frequency. The hovering term also has a tooltip that appears and that provides the term frequency as well as the number of documents in which that term appears.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"../tool/TermsBerry/?corpus=austen&subtitle=The+Works+of+Jane+Austen\" style=\"min-width: 500px; max-width:90%; height: 500px;\"></iframe>\n\n\n<div style=\"width: 90%; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;\">TermsBerry with the Works of Jane Austen.
