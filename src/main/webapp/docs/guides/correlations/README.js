A coefficient that approaches 1 indicates that values correlate positively, they rise and fall together. A coefficient that approaches -1 indicates that values correlate negatively, frequencies rise for one term as it drops for the other. Coefficients that approach 0 indicate little correlation, positive or negative. This value is the Pearsons correlation as calculated by the <a href=\"http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-math/javadocs/api-3.6.1/org/apache/commons/math3/stat/regression/SimpleRegression.html\">Apache Math Commons library SimpleRegression class</a>.</p>\n\n<p>This significance value is a measure of confidence in the correlation value. Often a significance of .05 or less indicates a strong correlation (which allows us to reject the null hypothesis that values are randomly distributed). The validity of this measure depends on assumptions about a normal distribution of the data. Also, don't forget that we typically have a relatively small number of values (frequencies from segments in a texts or from texts in a document), so these values should be used with care.</p>\n\n<iframe src=\"../tool/Correlations/?corpus=austen&subtitle=The+Works+of+Jane+Austen\" style=\"width: 90%; height: 350px;\"></iframe>\n\n\n<div style=\"width: 90%; text-align: center; margin-bottom: 1em;\">Contexts with the Works of Jane Austen.

The coverage determines how many of the relative frequency values can be zero before the term is excluded. For instance, if a corpus has 10 documents and the minimum coverage is 20%, at least two of the documents must contain the term or it will be ignored.</p>\n\n<p>If your corpus has more than one document you will see a Scale button that will allow you to toggle between the entire corpus and one or more individual documents. Again, the values change: for a corpus, it's the relative frequency for each document; for a document, it's the relative frequency for each segment.</p>\n\n<p>Clicking on the <a href=\"#!/guide/options\">Options</a> icon also allows you to define a set of stopwords to exclude â€“ see the <a href=\"#!/guide/stopwords\">stopwords guide</a> for more information.</p>\n\n<h2 id='correlations-section-additional-information'>Additional Information</h2>\n\n<p>The Correlations tool uses <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pearson_correlation_coefficient\">Pearson's Correlation</a>, which is a robust measure but assumes that values are distributed normally on an interval scale.</p>\n\n<h2 id='correlations-section-see-also'>See Also</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"#!/guide/start\">Getting Started</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#!/guide/grids\">Grids</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#!/guide/skins-section-default-skin\">Default Skin</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"#!/guide/tools\">List of Tools</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n","title":"Correlations"});
